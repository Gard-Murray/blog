# Daemon

DMs often want to place non-hostile NPCs in dungeons or wilderness for players to interact with. But 

It's convenient for DMs to place 


Different D&D classes can accumulate various kinds of pets/companions. Wizards have familiars, rangers have animal companions, paladins (may) have mounts, etc.

GMPCs have some dangers
take away spotlight/agency from players
temptation to railroad
in part because they're *always there*

but they're convenient because it allows you to offer plot, exposition "on demand" in the dungeon or adventuring site

one way to try to have cake/eat it would be an NPC who's available on demand but at a cost
the ideal type being some kind of Daemon, a supernatural entity that can be summoned

probably obtained through play rather than as a class ability, though you can imagine integrating it into a Warlock-style class
players could sacrifice...
- gold/treasure
- spell slots
- XP

with the amount spent increasing the reaction roll on summoning. get a 12, active help. get a 1, they refuse to be summoned again.


alternatively, think of this as the daemon of a particular place
but rather than an NPC just sitting around waiting to be encountered
it's something the players need to summon (and need to know how to summon)

a cleric probably gets a bonus to contacting all kinds of daemon, druids for spirits of natural places
and then there might be class-specific bonuses depending on the persona of the daemon themselves
so if you have the daemon of a great warrior, a fighter and cleric doing the summoning, you get +2

if you're thinking about what kind of messages to leave in druid's secret language or thieves' cant, hints at local daemons and what they like to have sacrificied to them would be appropriate


Warrior who killed specific foe
