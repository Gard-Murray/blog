# Present

> On the morrow they travelled towards Dyfed and made for the court of Arberth, and a feast was there in readiness for them. There came to them the full muster of the land and the dominion, of the foremost men and the foremost ladies. Neither man nor woman of these left Rhiannon without being given a memorable gift, either a brooch or a ring or a precious stone. They ruled the land prosperously that year and the next.

If she's smart, a new queen arriving in a medieval Welsh kingdom makes sure to bring gifts for all the key political players. This makes a good impression, securing her new position. And it's something we can use in our D&D games.

Treasure often comes in two forms: things PCs will want to use themselves, and things PCs will want to sell. In the first category, you have your immoveable rods, assorted rings of power, battleaxes enchanted to cleave metal like wood and play a jingle when they cleave foes, etc. In the second, you have your silver gryphon ewers, damask tapestries, gilt-bound librams, red velvet bags of glittering sapphires each containing the soul of a mighty hero of old, etc.

Savvy PCs will already be trading items from this second category to various NPCs they encounter. But these transfers are often exchanges: that is, they're *explicitly transactional.*[^1] The passage about Rhiannon above suggests a different mode of transfer that is *strategic but not immediately transactional*.

If PCs are living in or passing through a gift-giving culture, they might be expected to deploy their treasure to build networks of alliances and favors *without expecting anything explicit in return*. PCs don't get the benefit right away: they're betting on future goodwill, not buying immediate value or obedience.

This has a range of uses, providing new treasure-sinks, decision points, options for set-dressing, and methods for quest-giving. 

PCs' wealth tends to quickly outpace their regular expenses. Past a certain point, PCs are no longer saving up for commercially available equipment. Some systems deal with this by imposing high lifestyle costs or requiring expensive training or carousing to gain XP.[^inflation] Gift-giving provides a new and potentially more interesting treasure-sink for parties whose pack-mules are sagging under their ill-gotten riches. Want to build your power and authority in a region? Better be ready to distribute those baubles and brooches to the priests and petty lords. 

Unlike lifestyle costs or training, which tend to act as passive taxes on player wealth, gift-giving offers new decision points for players who enjoy political and diplomatic play. Who should receive the choicest rubies? Is there anyone we can afford to snub by giving them these ugly bronze candlesticks? Which of the bishops would be most intrigued by the heretical woodcuts we found in the cult library? A well-chosen gift might provide extra benefits for a savvy party. 

If you're running the kind of game where PCs maintain relationships with a large cast of NPCs, then you probably already have a spreadsheet to which you can columns for gifts given and received. Because the benefits don't come immediately, the DM has time after the session to think through the long-term effects of gift choices.

As a nice bonus, gift-giving means treasure doesn't simply disappear into a merchant's inventory when you get back to town. As you visit NPCs, they might display your earlier gifts, wearing the platinum armbands wrought like snakes that you stole from the Ouroborous Knights, or hanging above their mantle the ivory war-horn you stole from the Tyrant of the Plains. Set-dressing becomes a way to remind players both of the relationships they've built and the adventures they've been on.

Several times in the Mabinogion, lords holding court will show off by offering to fulfill requests from random visitors. This often gets them in trouble, as when Pwywl prince of Dyfed offers "whatever boon thou ask of me, so far as I can get it" to Gwawl son of Clud, who promptly asks for the hand of Pwywl's beloved, the aforementioned Rhiannon. Pwywl is in a bind, but Rhiannon comes up with a (complicated) plan to trick Gwawl out of his request through the same system. Even though Gwawl is clever enough to only offer "a reasonable boon" to the rag-clothed stranger (Pwywl in disguise), he ends up stepping into a magic bag and getting tied up and kicked until he relinquishes his claim over Rhiannon. Live by weird customs, die by weird customs.

Besides giving us some insight into the zany love triangles of Dyfed, this suggests one more use for gift-giving: if players are serving a lord or are already established as powers themselves, NPCs might show up and as a matter of courtesy expect to be granted an open-ended request. These kinds of requests are ripe for delivering adventure hooks in a way that's more socially grounded than the usual tavern noticeboard Fantasy Craiglist.
